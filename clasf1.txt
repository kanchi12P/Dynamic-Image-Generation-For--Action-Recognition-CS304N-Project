This code defines a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using Keras API in TensorFlow. Here's a brief explanation of what the code is doing:

The first line creates a new sequential model object.
Two convolutional layers are added to the model, each followed by a max pooling layer and a dropout layer. The first layer has 50 filters of size 3x3 and the second has 75 filters of size 3x3. Both layers use "same" padding and ReLU activation.
Two more convolutional layers are added, followed by max pooling and dropout. The third layer has 125 filters of size 3x3 and uses "same" padding and ReLU activation.
The output of the last convolutional layer is flattened and passed to two dense layers with ReLU activation and dropout.
The output layer is a dense layer with softmax activation, which gives the probability distribution over the 10 possible classes.
The model is compiled with categorical cross-entropy loss, Adam optimizer, and accuracy metric.
The model is trained on the training data (X_train and Y_train) for 10 epochs with a batch size of 128, and the validation data (X_test and Y_test) is used to evaluate the model's performance after each epoch.
Overall, this model is designed for image classification with 10 possible classes, and it uses convolutional layers to extract features from the input images. The dropout layers are used for regularization to prevent overfitting. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer, which adapts the learning rate during training to improve convergence speed and performance.

explain each layer in detail
Sure, here is a detailed explanation of each layer in the model:

Conv2D layer with 50 filters, kernel size of 3x3, strides of 1x1, padding of 'same', and ReLU activation:

This layer applies 50 filters to the input image, each of size 3x3.
The padding is set to 'same', which means that the output has the same spatial dimensions as the input.
The ReLU activation function is used to introduce non-linearity into the output of this layer.
Conv2D layer with 75 filters, kernel size of 3x3, strides of 1x1, padding of 'same', and ReLU activation:

This layer applies 75 filters to the output of the previous layer, each of size 3x3.
The padding is set to 'same' again, and the ReLU activation function is used.
MaxPool2D layer with pool size of 2x2:

This layer performs max pooling on the output of the previous layer, reducing its spatial dimensions by half.
Max pooling returns the maximum value in each non-overlapping 2x2 block of the input.
Dropout layer with a rate of 0.25:

This layer randomly drops out 25% of the neurons in the output of the previous layer during training, which helps prevent overfitting.
Conv2D layer with 125 filters, kernel size of 3x3, strides of 1x1, padding of 'same', and ReLU activation:

This layer applies 125 filters to the output of the previous dropout layer, each of size 3x3.
The padding is set to 'same', and the ReLU activation function is used.
MaxPool2D layer with pool size of 2x2:

This layer performs max pooling on the output of the previous layer, reducing its spatial dimensions by half.
Dropout layer with a rate of 0.25:

This layer randomly drops out 25% of the neurons in the output of the previous layer during training, which helps prevent overfitting.
Flatten layer:

This layer flattens the output of the previous layer into a 1D vector, which is then passed to the dense layers.
Dense layer with 500 units and ReLU activation:

This layer is a fully connected layer with 500 neurons, and the ReLU activation function is used.
Dropout layer with a rate of 0.4:

This layer randomly drops out 40% of the neurons in the output of the previous layer during training, which helps prevent overfitting.
Dense layer with 250 units and ReLU activation:

This layer is another fully connected layer with 250 neurons, and the ReLU activation function is used.
Dropout layer with a rate of 0.3:

This layer randomly drops out 30% of the neurons in the output of the previous layer during training, which helps prevent overfitting.
Dense layer with 10 units and softmax activation:

This layer is the output layer, and it has 10 neurons, one for each class.
The softmax activation function is used to convert the output of the previous layer into a probability distribution over the classes.
Finally, the model is compiled with categorical cross-entropy loss, Adam optimizer, and accuracy metric, and then trained on the training data for 10 epochs with a batch size of 128. The validation data is used to evaluate the model
